animate-textshadow is a simple, lightweight (< 1KB minified + gzipped) jQuery plugin which lets you animate an element's text-shadow property, using jQuery's regular .animate method.

The plugin should work with all browsers that support the text-shadow property: Firefox 3.1+, Chrome 2+, Opera 9.5+ (untested), Safari 1.1+ (untested), IE9+. If you have to detect text-shadow support, see here for a how-to.
